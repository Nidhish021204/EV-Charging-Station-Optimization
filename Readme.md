**EV Charging Station Optimization using Machine Learning and Traffic Data**

**Project Overview**

This project aims to optimize the placement of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations across New York City by analyzing traffic patterns and EV station data using machine learning models. The model identifies high-traffic areas with low EV station density, helping in determining where new stations should be installed to meet demand effectively.

**Problem Statement**

EV charging infrastructure is critical for supporting the growth of electric vehicles. However, determining optimal locations for charging stations is a challenge, especially in large cities like New York. This project addresses the problem of optimizing the placement and distribution of EV charging stations by analyzing traffic and existing station data.

**Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Data analysis, model training, and testing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models like Linear Regression and K-Means clustering.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualizing data and clustering results.
- **Geopandas**: Spatial data handling and geospatial analysis.
- **Intel OneAPI Libraries**: For optimizing model performance.
- **Google Drive**: Datasets stored and accessed via public links for large files.

**How It Works**

1. **Data Collection**: Traffic data from New York City and EV station data (USA and Germany) were cleaned and preprocessed.
1. **Data Analysis**: Traffic data was grouped by street segments to understand traffic flow and volume. EV station data was analyzed to determine the number of stations per location.
1. **Model Training**:
   1. A Linear Regression model was trained to predict the need for new EV stations based on traffic volume and existing station density.
   1. A K-Means clustering model was used to cluster locations based on traffic volume to identify high-demand areas.
1. **Optimization**: Intel OneAPI libraries were used to optimize the performance of machine learning models, ensuring faster training and efficient handling of large datasets.
1. **Prediction**: The model identifies streets with high traffic volume and low station availability as the best candidates for installing new EV charging stations.

**Results**

The trained model successfully identifies high-demand locations for new EV stations based on traffic data. Streets with high traffic volume and low EV station presence are suggested for further station installations to optimize accessibility and reduce congestion.
